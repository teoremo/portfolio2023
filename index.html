                        <p>I joined BlueLayer during a growth phase when the product needed solid foundational structure and design leadership. Our team built the product while navigating the complex carbon credit market which required both hands-on execution and systemic thinking to establish sustainable design practices. The nature of my role evolved to encompass both leadership and strategic contribution across multiple areas. I helped establish solid product foundations in close collaboration with the CPO and CTO, while leading our small design team of two.
                        </p>
                        <p>I drove key design decisions such as formalising the navigation architecture and building the design system - and led design initiatives from concept through to production, including creating low-fidelity prototypes, and conducting research sessions with customers. I designed complex solutions including an orders management system for carbon credits, and features aimed at manipulating projects data and sharing them with external stakeholders.

                        in a

                        <p>I joined the Taxfix team right at the peak of the tax season, when most individuals file
                            their yearly submissions. The product could already count on a solid base of satisfied
                            customers, and the team relied on a number of specific assumptions aimed at <strong>meeting
                                ambitious growth targets for revenues and market share</strong>. My initial focus was to
                            <strong>validate a new service offering</strong> with potential users before launching, and
                            to support the design team enhancing the user experience of the product.
                        </p>
                        <p>Over the course of the first few months, however, the team was met with several unforeseen
                            <strong>external and internal challenges</strong>. These obstacles had the potential to
                            adversely impact the Italian product and, as a result, the entire business.
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to mitigate the potential risk, I switched my focus towards <strong>providing
                                strategic guidance</strong> to product stakeholders, while leading improvements to work
                            practices and mentoring less experienced colleagues. This included <strong>co-designing a
                                vision and roadmap of initiatives, defining and running product experiments, and
                                bringing people together</strong> across different areas of the business and helped the

                        <p>Alongside a strong team of <strong>multidisciplinary experts</strong>, ranging from machine
                            learning engineers to innovation directors, I leveraged Service Design to facilitate
                            alignment among the various civil servant stakeholders. Through this approach, I was able to
                            create a <strong>shared understanding of the goals, strategies, and potential
                                implications</strong> of a high-profile project.</p>
                        <p>This was instrumental in establishing the Innovation Lab as a <strong>trusted and reliable
                                partner</strong> for the department in tackling complex and interconnected societal
                            challenges.</p>

                    Most of my recent work is currently under NDA.<br />
                    I’d be more than happy to talk you through some of the main
                    projects I
                    was
                    part of, and how these experience could help shape how we can work together.

                    He brought a lot of seniority and transformed the design approach of the team. He quickly picked
                    up the most challenging initiatives and was able to make a tangible contribution very quickly.
