                    <strong>I’m a versatile designer.</strong><br />
                    I call on on a number of disciplines - spanning from design thinking to agile product
                    management -
                    to bring in a <i>flexible human-centered</i> approach to product, service and business
                    innovation
                    challenges.

                    › designing & facilitating tailored workshops<br />
                    › mapping complex systems & detailing experiences<br />
                    › conducting rigorous design research - <br />
                    secondary, qualitative & quantitative<br />
                    › defining holistic roadmaps & measurable objectives<br />

                    <p>
                        I worked in a cross-functional team to refine the strategy to achieve product-market fit
                        in a
                        new territory. I designed and ran experiments, and addressed hands-on product design
                        needs,
                        while providing guidance to the wider team to ensure we were ready for the following tax
                        season.

                        <p>I joined the Taxfix team right at the peak of the tax season, when most individuals file
                            their yearly submissions. The product could already count on a solid base of satisfied
                            customers, and the team relied on a number of specific assumptions aimed at <strong>meeting
                                ambitious growth targets for revenues and market share</strong>. My initial focus was to
                            <strong>validate a new service offering</strong> with potential users before launching, and
                            to support the design team enhancing the user experience of the product.
                        </p>
                        <p>Over the course of the first few months, however, the team was met with several unforeseen
                            <strong>external and internal challenges</strong>. These obstacles had the potential to
                            adversely impact the Italian product and, as a result, the entire business.
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to mitigate the potential risk, I switched my focus towards <strong>providing
                                strategic guidance</strong> to product stakeholders, while leading improvements to work
                            practices and mentoring less experienced colleagues. This included <strong>co-designing a
                                vision and roadmap of initiatives, defining and running product experiments, and
                                bringing people together</strong> across different areas of the business and helped the
                            team getting back in shape for the following tax season.</p>

                        <p>In 2021, the global retail bank had a remarkable opportunity to showcase their
                            industry-leading sustainability strategy at the pivotal COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.
                            However, they faced the challenging task of not only <strong>bringing together all of their
                                ambitious sustainability efforts</strong> but also presenting them in a captivating and
                            cohesive format that would truly resonate with the conference audience.</p>
                        <p>Collaborating with a tight-knit team of seasoned senior design strategists, I worked around
                            the clock to craft a winning solution for the bank. We delved deep into the intricacies of
                            their business, <strong>interviewing top-level management and conducting a series of dynamic
                                ideation workshops</strong> to fuel our creativity.</p>
                        <p>After a rigorous ideation process and a review of secondary and desk-based research, we
                            unveiled a revolutionary set of <strong>behavior-change-based initiatives</strong> that
                            revolved around the brilliant concept of "home as the fulcrum for sustainable change." These
                            initiatives were designed to encompass different areas of customers' lives, empowering them
                            to lead more sustainable lifestyles on a day-to-day basis.</p>
                        <p>Despite the very limited time available to unravel the challenge, the final result managed to
                            showcase the bank's unwavering commitment to sustainability, and our team’s ability to
                            <strong>help them bring their vision to life</strong> with creativity and ingenuity.

                        <p>The Department for Work and Pensions is tasked with addressing a plethora of
                            <strong>intricate and multifaceted challenges</strong> that British citizens face on a
                            regular basis. These challenges are often intertwined and layered, requiring a comprehensive
                            and nuanced approach to effectively tackle them. Unfortunately, policymakers frequently lack
                            the necessary resources, time, and freedom to develop original, impartial, and comprehensive
                            solutions to these challenges.
                        </p>
                        <p>To help overcome these obstacles, our team played a crucial role in establishing a dedicated
                            Innovation Lab, designed to <strong>experiment with new and innovative methods of addressing
                                these challenges</strong>, and finding novel ways to better serve the citizens of
                            tomorrow. Over the course of several months, the Innovation Lab took on a diverse range of
                            complex and interrelated challenges. These challenges included <strong>tackling the
                                consequences of an ageing population and its impact on unemployment rates</strong> and
                            <strong>addressing issues related to health and safety in the workplace.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alongside a strong team of <strong>multidisciplinary experts</strong>, ranging from machine
                            learning engineers to innovation directors, I leveraged Service Design to facilitate
                            alignment among the various civil servant stakeholders. Through this approach, I was able to
                            create a <strong>shared understanding of the goals, strategies, and potential
                                implications</strong> of a high-profile project.</p>
                        <p>This was instrumental in establishing the Innovation Lab as a <strong>trusted and reliable
                                partner</strong> for the department in tackling complex and interconnected societal
                            challenges.</p>
