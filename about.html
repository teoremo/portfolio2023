                <h2>About me</h2>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>I’m a bit of a (design) nerd.</strong><br />After a BSc in Communication Design and a
                    MSc in
                    Product-Service System Design I moved to London in 2015, and <a
                        href="https://www.servicedesigntoday.org">researched Service Design</a>.<br> I’m still
                    fascinated by how the discipline evolves.
                </p>
                <p><strong>I’m an adaptable person</strong>.<br />
                    I worked across different industries, with clients such as LEGO, Shelter, British Government, Elekta, Ocado, Barclays, HSBC, Taxfix. I’ve learned what works - and what doesn’t - in organisations of varying size.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>I care about our planet.</strong><br>
                    About the people who inhabit it, and the nature we all share.<br>
                    My mum still lives in the council estate I was raised in, in the outskirts of Milan.
                    <br>I spent many weekends in the countryside helping out my grandpa, or cycling in the hills
                    just
                    outside Piacenza with my dad.<br>
                    When I joined Shelter, the homelessness charity, as their first service designer - <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDWj-8kX-Zs">I've learned</a> how harsh our system can
                    be
                    for people suffering from the inequalities of our broken system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>I like to make stuff.</strong><br>
                    In my early 20s, while studying, I co-run a small design studio - printing our graphics on
                    t-shirts
                    and experimenting with interaction design technologies.
                    <br>I tend to make sense of complex problems through research and mapping, but I also love
                    making
                    things tangible whenever possible - to learn from them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Above all, I like to establish clear work relationships based on respect, mutual trust and open
                    dialogue.</strong>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    “Matteo was a pleasure to work with at all times throughout our project. I was impressed with
                    how
                    quickly he grasped the subject matter and he was quick to turn around iterations between
                    workshop
                    sessions. </p>
                <p>Matteo is also a skilled workshop facilitator with great ideas for organising complicated content
                    and
                    was able to move us along when we got stuck whilst being careful not to rush the critical
                    topics.
                </p>
                <p>The resulting outputs were of high quality and continue to be referred to since.”</p>
