            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I’m an adaptable person.<br />
                My work spans in-house and agency-side - for corporate, government, tech unicorn, and non-profit clients such as LEGO, Elekta, British Government, Ocado, Barclays, HSBC, Taxfix. <br />
                I’ve learned what works - and what doesn’t - in organisations of varying size.
            </p><p>
                I’m a bit of a (design) nerd.<br/>After a BSc in Communication Design and a MSc in Product-Service System Design I moved to London in 2015, and <a href="https://www.servicedesigntoday.org">researched Service Design</a>.<br> I’m still fascinated by how the discipline evolves.
            </p><p>
                I care about our planet.<br>
                About the people who inhabit it, and the nature we all share.<br>
                My mum still lives in the council estate I was raised in, in the outskirts of Milan.
                <br>I spent many weekends in the countryside helping out my grandpa, or cycling in the hills just outside Piacenza with my dad.<br>
                When I joined Shelter, the homelessness charity, as their first service designer - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDWj-8kX-Zs">I've learned</a> how harsh our system can be for people suffering from the inequalities of our broken system.
            </p><p>
                I like to make stuff.<br>
                In my early 20s, while studying, I co-run a small design studio - printing our graphics on t-shirts and experimenting with interaction design technologies.
                <br>I tend to make sense of complex problems through research and mapping, but I also love making things tangible whenever possible - to learn from them.
            </p><p>
                Above all, I like to establish clear work relationships based on respect, mutual trust and open dialogue.

                <p>
                    “Matteo was a pleasure to work with at all times throughout our project. I was impressed with how quickly he grasped the subject matter and he was quick to turn around iterations between workshop sessions. </p>
                <p>Matteo is also a skilled workshop facilitator with great ideas for organising complicated content and was able to move us along when we got stuck whilst being careful not to rush the critical topics. 
                </p>
                <p>The resulting outputs were of high quality and continue to be referred to since.”</p>

                <h2>About working together</h2>
                <p>I want to support organisations, teams and communities who are creating alternative models and narratives for the future - in the context of the climate transition.</p>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, climate change is only a symptom of a much broader, systemic crisis. I believe that our society needs to undergo a fundamental paradigm shift. <br />
                    I’d love to contribute shaping it - in a way that is regenerative for nature, people and business.</p>
                    <p>
